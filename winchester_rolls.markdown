# The Pipe Rolls of the Bishopric of Winchester
***

## Project Aim
This repository serves as the home for an in-progress project to analyze the medieval Pipe Rolls of the Bishopric of Winchester. At this initial stage, texts have been selected based on full-text availability and suitability for transformational, programmatic analysis. Four primary texts have been selected based on their completeness and availability. These texts are (or will be) encoded with a customized TEI schema that focuses on various informatic elements included in the documents such as people's names, places, categories of labor, labor or wage value, agricultural produce, and the like. Other texts will be added to fill in gaps in the data where possible, though many other texts focus on individual manors, rather than the entirety of the holdings of the Bishopric. This project will eventually aim to incorporate transcriptions of the remaining manorial rolls, though this will require many years of work. In the meantime, this project will grow based on enriching the printed editions of various texts that contain aspects of the Pipe Rolls to fill in gaps where possible.

In addition, this project will provide various computational displays of the data presented in the rolls. Examples of which can be found on the [Data Visualization Page](../visualization/)

## Task List (in-progress):
- Generate plaintext file from Page volume (2/2)
- Separate manors and account categories into discrete tabular data \(partial example available [here](https://github.com/comp-methods-fsu-2021/hunter_winchesterrolls/blob/master/1208-1209_Holt/1208-1209_Holt_z_tabularExperiment-openRefine.tsv) \)
- Generate clean tabular data for Hall and Page volumes
- Compile additional published datasets into corpus (TBD)
- Encode




## Task List (completed):
- Generate plaintext files from Page volumes (1/2)
- Remove page numbers & line breaks 
- Separate editorial content from primary data
- Excise footnotes/emendations into separate files by volume

## Future Plans (timeline TBD):
- Encode text in TEI to encode different functional elements / classes of cost
- Generate prosopographical corpus of named persons?
