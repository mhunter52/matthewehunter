Hello world!

This site is where I'll be posting portions of my research into the Pipe Rolls of the Bishopric of Winchester. It's my hope to begin to analyse the price and production amounts of the various manors recounted there, and eventually investigate how the amount of agricultural produce changed over time, and how that impacted the dietary realities of the people living and working on the lands represented in these rolls.
