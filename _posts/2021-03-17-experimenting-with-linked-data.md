# Experimenting with Linked Data


## Problems this week:
- Wikipedia (as a source of contemporary information as well as historical) has an up-to-date entry about the office of the Bishop of Winchester, including historical records of many people who held that title. It also contains an entry for the Diocese of Winchester as a unit of ecclesiastical governance. It does not have an entry on the Bishopric as an economic unit, or as a historical bishopric as part of the Catholic church, however. As mentioned above, there are references within the Wikidata unierse to various bishops as "position held" - "Anglican Bishop of Winchester." However, this is obviously nonsense since Swithun lived from the early 800s to 862\* and the "Anglican" Church was not established until Henry VIII established himself as separate and Supreme Head of the Church of England with the Supremacy Act of 1534. So, linking data becomes a problem for someone like Swithun, who was indeed a bishop, and who indeed served as the head of a episcopal see in Winchester, but who would not have identified with the title of "Anglican Bishop." Yet the line of data continuity (especially for something like the machine-readable aspects of the Wikidata Identifier codes) works best with a continuous through-line of Bishops "replaced by" [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P1366](P:1366) eachother, historical nomenclature and periodicity be damned.
