## Data for this project
During the course of this project, I have attempted to create data from the pipe rolls in many different ways, and to do a variety of things with that data. This page will serve as a directory of those attempts, organized in as much of a logical format as I can.

#### Data creation
- Quantifying the records via calculating total value (in pence) of annual incomes and expenses of the various manors, and an attempt to visualize these with Tableau: [Quantification](/quantification.markdown)
- Visualizing the geographic extent of the manors listed in 1210-1211 (via map), a timeline of the bishops of Winchester during the medieval period, listing the word-count length of each manor's "Purchasia" record entries (which outlines capital outlays by the manor throughout the year), and the "Account rendered" record (which records the amount paid to the bishop from each manor), as well as a visualization of receipts and expenses for four of the manors: [Visualization](/visualizations.markdown)

#### Editions
- Attempting to create XML-encoded TEI editions of the rolls' text: [XML Editions](/xml_rolls.md)
