This website is a demo portfolio for the work being done by Matthew Hunter. Here you'll (eventually) find a lot of content related to digital scholarship, including 3D printing, virtual reality and interactive 3D humanities scholarship, as well as some work on the [Winchester Pipe Rolls](https://www.hants.gov.uk/librariesandarchives/archives/collections/piperolls)
